## Customer Churn Analysis Using Machine Learning Algorithms - Reproducibility Code
This repository contains the reproducibility code and results for the paper titled "Customer Churning Analysis Using Machine Learning Algorithms" by B. Prabadevi, R. Shalini, and B.R. Kavitha.

Our team has implemented the code following the chosen architecture and methodology outlined in the paper, aiming to closely replicate the original results. However, since the paper did not explicitly detail certain parameters and processes, our reproduced results may vary slightly.

### Project Overview
This project applies machine learning techniques to analyze customer churn, implementing and testing various algorithms as described in the original paper. It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation to gain insights into the factors contributing to customer churn.
